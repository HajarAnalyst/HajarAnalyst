👋 Hi, I’m @HajarAnalyst, or you can call me HajarStillBecomingAnalyst 😅
- 👀 I’m passionate about learning more about the data analyst role, with the goal of transitioning into data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming languages like Python, SQL, and PL/SQL, as well as DAX in Power BI. I love turning raw data into valuable insights, and I know there's still so much to learn!
- 💞️ I’m looking for an internship to sharpen my skills and move closer to becoming a skilled data analyst, and eventually a data scientist.
- 🎓 I am currently a master's student in France, studying in Orléans. I’m pursuing a degree in Management of Information Systems with a focus on Data Science. My studies have given me a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and database management, and I’m eager to apply these skills in real-world projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not working with data, I enjoy exploring different culinary cultures and revisiting recipes with my own personal twist. I also love playing building games like Satisfactory and watching true crime or paranormal documentaries.
