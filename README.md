👋 Hello, I’m Hajar,
- 👀 I’m passionate about learning more about the data analyst role, with the goal of transitioning into data science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming languages like Python, SQL, and PL/SQL, as well as DAX in Power BI. I love turning raw data into valuable insights, and I know there's still so much to learn!
- 💞️ Here is my portfolio showcasing some of my personal work: https://hajaranalyst.github.io/Portfolio/. This is just the beginning 💪.
- 🎓 I have a master's in Management of Information Systems with a focus on Data Science. My studies have given me a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and database management, and I’m eager to apply these skills in real-world projects.
